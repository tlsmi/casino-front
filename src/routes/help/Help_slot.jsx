          Slot machines are popular casino games that operate based on random number generation (RNG).
          When you play a slot machine, you spin the reels and hope to match certain symbols or patterns to win prizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a step-by-step explanation of how slot machines work:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Reels:</strong> Slot machines typically have three or more spinning reels with various symbols on them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paylines:</strong> Paylines are the lines across the reels where winning combinations can occur.
            The number of paylines varies depending on the slot machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spin:</strong> To play, you place a bet and spin the reels. The reels spin and eventually come to a stop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Random Number Generator (RNG):</strong> Behind the scenes, a random number generator (RNG) generates
            random numbers that determine the position of the symbols on the reels when they stop spinning.
            This ensures that each spin is independent and random.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Winning Combinations:</strong> If the symbols on the reels align in a winning combination
            along a payline, you win a prize. Different combinations have different payout values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payouts:</strong> Slot machines have predetermined payout percentages that determine how much
            of the money wagered on the machine will be paid out as winnings over time. The payout percentage is
            typically displayed as a percentage and can vary from machine to machine.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It's important to remember that slot machines are games of chance, and the outcomes are determined by RNG.
          While some strategies and tips can enhance your experience, there is no guaranteed way to win at slots.
          Play responsibly and have fun!
